# governance
This repo details the current governance structure of clr.fund, including addresses on various chains.

Clr.fund seeks to be a meritocratic Decentralized Autonomous Organisation (DAO). It is worth noting the distinction between clr.fund the protocol, on which quadratic funding rounds are run, and clr.fund the collective building the former. For the purpose of this document, clr.fund refers to the latter.
